# Embedded Systems Laboratory - group 06

### Folders content
- `assignment_01`: Contains the code related to the first assignment
- `helloDSP`: Contains the provided sample program, showing how to pass messages between GPP (ARM core) and DSP

### TODO
- Measure execution time, including time spent on sending/receiving messages to/from the DSP and on computing the product, and compute the speedup
- Measure the execution cycles on the DSP
- Measure the commmunicaiton overhead
- Explore compiler flags possibilities
- Derive application information from profilers (MCProf and gprof)
- Document the code extensively
- Start the report
